to run the project:
python mutate.py ADAgene.fasta 239 129 G ADAprotein.fasta

ADAgene.fasta is the file contain the gene of ADA
239 is the position for mutation
129 is the initial star codon CDS
G is the mutation of the DNA at opsition 239
ADAprotein.fasta is the files contain the protein sequence
