### mutate DNA and its protein sequence at the corresponding amino acid site
### example of what the program is mutating DNA and its Protein sequence
#### Given gene ADA (RefSeq NM_000022.2), forward translate the DNA substitution mutation c.239A>G to the expected amino acid change and codon position.
#### c.239A>G denotes that at nucleotide 239 an A is changed to a G. Nucleotide 1 is the A of the ATG-translation initiation codon.

#### Find the mRNA in the GenBank at NCBI at the following website:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000022.2/
#### Save the FASTA file of the sequence of NM_000022.2, the mRNA of Homo sapiens adenosine deaminase (ADA) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000022.2/

#### Find out the corresponding change of amino acid, based on the codon change. Since the c239A>G will mutate AAA into AGA, by looking up into a DNA codon table, we could conclude a Lysine(K) has been mutated into an Arginine(R) at position math.

#### get the protein sequence from the website below: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_000013.2?report=fasta

#### Get the mutated protein sequence by changing the amino acid. For ADA protein sequence, change the Lysine(K) at position 80 of protein sequence into the Arginine(R).
